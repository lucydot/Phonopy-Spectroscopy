# Welcome to Phonopy-Spectroscopy

Welcome to the documentation site for `Phonopy-Spectroscopy`.

`Phonopy-Spectroscopy` adds the capability to simulate vibrational spectra to the [Phonopy code](https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/).

The software consists of a Python package, `phonopy_spectroscopy`, and command-line scripts for performing typical calculations.
It is hosted on the [Phonopy-Spectroscopy Github Repository](https:skelton-group.github.io/phonopy_spectroscopy) and is available to use and adapt under the open-source [MIT License](https://github.com/lucydot/Phonopy-Spectroscopy/blob/develop/LICENSE).

## Recent upgrades (September 2025)

* The "backend" Python API has been completely rewritten with a new object model.
* The infrared (IR) capability has been rewritten around computing the IR dielectric function, with options to account for different measurement geometries including powder averaging.
* The Raman capability has been expanded to include complete functionality for simulating single-crystal and powder Raman experiments, including with energy-dependent Raman tensors.
* Unit tests have been implemented with reasonable code coverage.
* The command-line programs and associated API have been temporarily removed pending a rewrite.
