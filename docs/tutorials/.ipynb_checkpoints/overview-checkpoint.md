# Phonopy Spectroscopy Tutorials

### [Benzene Derivatives](./benzene_derivatives_tutorial.md)

In this tutorial, we compare simulated IR spectra of benzene and several derivatives to high-quality gas-phase spectra from the [NIST Chemistry WebBook](http://webbook.nist.gov/).

### [α-SiO2](./SiO2_tutorial.md)

In this tutorial, we perform a detailed simulation of the infrared (IR) and Raman spectra of α-SiO2 (quartz) in the P3221 spacegroup.

### [Test](./test_tutorial.ipynb)

In this tutorial, we are checking that a Jupyter Notebook is compiled correctly.
